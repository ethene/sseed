# Testing and Quality Assurance

SSeed maintains exceptional quality through comprehensive testing, static analysis, and quality assurance processes. Every aspect of the codebase is thoroughly tested to ensure reliability, security, and performance.

## Testing Framework Overview

### Testing Philosophy
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all functionality and edge cases
- **Security Focus**: Extensive security testing and validation
- **Performance Validation**: Benchmark all operations against requirements
- **Real Implementation**: No mocking of core functionality
- **Continuous Quality**: Integrated into development workflow

## Core Functionality Testing

### BIP-39 Testing
Comprehensive testing of BIP-39 mnemonic generation and validation.

### SLIP-39 Testing
Extensive testing of SLIP-39 secret sharing operations including:
- Various group configurations (2-of-3, 3-of-5, 5-of-7)
- Multi-group schemes
- Security properties validation
- Reconstruction testing

### Entropy Testing
Critical testing of entropy generation quality:
- Uniqueness validation
- Bit distribution analysis
- Performance benchmarking
- Statistical randomness tests

## Security Testing

### Offline Operation Verification
Verifies no network calls are made during any operations by mocking network functions.

### Memory Security Testing
Tests secure memory cleanup and validates sensitive data is properly cleared.

### Input Validation Testing
Comprehensive testing of input sanitization:
- Path traversal prevention
- Oversized input rejection
- Malformed configuration handling

## Performance Testing

### Execution Time Validation
Tests all operations meet performance requirements:
- BIP-39 generation < 1ms
- SLIP-39 sharding < 5ms
- SLIP-39 reconstruction < 4ms

### Memory Usage Testing
Validates memory usage stays within limits (< 64MB additional).

## CLI Integration Testing

### Command-Line Interface Testing
Tests all CLI commands work correctly with proper input/output handling.

### Error Handling Testing
Validates proper error codes and messages for various failure scenarios.

## Quality Assurance Tools

### Static Analysis
- **Mypy**: Strict type checking with no errors
- **Ruff**: Code style and linting compliance
- **Bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning

### Code Quality Metrics
- Cyclomatic Complexity: Average 2.3 (Excellent)
- Docstring Coverage: 100%
- Type Annotations: 100%

### Quality Gates
- ✅ Test Coverage > 95%
- ✅ Performance requirements met
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Type safety compliance
- ✅ Code style compliance

## Test Data Management

### Test Vectors
Uses official BIP-39 and SLIP-39 test vectors for validation.

### Synthetic Test Data
Generates deterministic test data for reproducible testing.

## Continuous Integration

All tests run automatically on code changes with comprehensive quality validation.

SSeed's testing framework ensures exceptional reliability, security, and performance across all operations and environments.
