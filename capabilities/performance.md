secure_delete_variable('entropy_bytes', locals())

shards = []  # List of strings, not objects
for shard in generate_shards(mnemonic):
    shards.append(shard)
    # No intermediate objects created
```

python -m cProfile -s cumulative -m sseed gen > /dev/null
```

### Performance Testing Framework

```python
def test_performance_requirements():
    """Test all performance requirements are met."""
    
    # Generation performance
    times = [measure_generation() for _ in range(100)]
    assert statistics.mean(times) < 50_000  # microseconds
    
    # Memory usage  
    baseline = measure_memory()
    peak = measure_memory_during_operation()
    assert (peak - baseline) < 64 * 1024 * 1024  # 64MB
    
    # Sharding performance
    shard_times = [measure_sharding() for _ in range(50)]
    assert statistics.mean(shard_times) < 50_000  # microseconds
```

## Optimization Guidelines

### For Maximum Performance
1. **Use SSDs**: Minimize I/O latency
2. **Disable Swap**: Prevent memory paging
3. **Warm Cache**: Run operations once to warm caches
4. **Batch Operations**: Use parallel processing for multiple operations
5. **Monitor Resources**: Watch for unexpected resource usage

### For Memory-Constrained Environments
1. **Process Individually**: Don't batch operations in memory
2. **Immediate Cleanup**: Use explicit variable deletion
3. **Monitor Peak Usage**: Track memory high-water marks
4. **Avoid Caching**: Don't cache results in memory

### For High-Volume Processing
1. **Parallel Execution**: Use multiple processes
2. **Pipeline Operations**: Stream processing where possible
3. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate ulimits
4. **Monitoring**: Track performance degradation
