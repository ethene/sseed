### 🔧 **Examples**

```bash
# Generate master seed and derive BIP85 children
sseed gen -o master.txt
sseed bip85 -i master.txt bip39 -w 12 -n 0    # First child mnemonic
sseed bip85 -i master.txt hex -b 32 -n 1      # Second child (32 bytes hex)
sseed bip85 -i master.txt password -l 20 -n 2 # Third child (20-char password)

# Workflow integration with SLIP39
sseed bip85 -i master.txt bip39 -w 12 -n 0 | sseed shard -g 3-of-5

# Optimized batch operations
sseed bip85 -i master.txt hex -b 16 -n 0,1,2,3,4  # Generate 5 entropy values
```
